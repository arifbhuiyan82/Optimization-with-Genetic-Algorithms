Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm and Tabu Search

This repository contains an implementation of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) combined with Tabu Search (TS) for refining the best solution. The objective is to optimize task scheduling across machines to minimize the total computational time (makespan).

 üìå Project Overview

This project consists of the following major components:

‚úÖ Genetic Algorithm (GA)

- Used to find an optimal or near-optimal task scheduling that minimizes makespan.
- Implements selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism techniques to improve solutions over generations.

‚úÖ Tabu Search (TS)

- A local search technique that refines the best GA-generated schedule, avoiding local optima traps.
- Uses tabu tenure, aspiration criteria, and stagnation limits to guide search efficiency.

‚úÖ Multiple Datasets

- The algorithm is tested on three datasets representing different problem complexities:
  - Small-scale: fisher_thompson_6x6 (6 jobs √ó 6 machines)
  - Medium-scale: fisher_thompson_10x10 (10 jobs √ó 10 machines)
  - Large-scale: adams_balas_and_zawack_15x20 (15 jobs √ó 20 machines)

‚úÖ Visualizations

- Gantt charts to visualize task scheduling.
- Fitness evolution plots to track solution improvement across generations.

 üìå Key Observations

‚úî GA Performance:

- The Genetic Algorithm alone achieved strong results, reducing makespan across all datasets.
- Larger populations (100-200) and higher crossover rates (0.7-0.8) generally improved solution quality.

‚úî Tabu Search Effectiveness:

- TS helped refine solutions, especially in Fisher & Thompson datasets.
- However, it was not always beneficial, as seen in Adams 15√ó20, where GA performed better.

‚úî Mutation Rate Impact:

- Low mutation (0.1): Converged too early.
- High mutation (0.3): Disrupted good solutions.
- Balanced mutation (0.2) worked best.

‚úî Runtime Considerations:

- Tabu Search added computational overhead but provided meaningful refinements in most cases.

 üìå Conclusion

‚úÖ Genetic Algorithm is an effective approach for JSSP, and it works well with proper parameter tuning.\
‚úÖ Tabu Search serves as a useful refinement tool, but its impact depends on the dataset complexity.\
‚úÖ Future Directions:

- Hybrid GA-TS Integration: Instead of applying TS after GA, integrate it within the GA evolution process.
- Larger-scale JSSP problems: Test on 20√ó20+ configurations to assess scalability.
- Comparing other metaheuristics (Simulated Annealing, Particle Swarm Optimization) to GA+TS.

---

 üìå Final Takeaways

- Genetic Algorithm alone performed well, but Tabu Search provided additional refinements in most cases.
- For complex datasets (15√ó20), GA alone performed better.
- Further tuning and hybridization of GA+TS can yield even better results in future research.
